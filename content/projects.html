<h3><a name="m-ibis">Ibis: Efficient Java Based Grid Computing</a></h3>

<p>
<a href="http://www.cs.vu.nl/ibis">The Ibis project</a>
is creating an efficient, Java-based platform for grid computing. The Ibis
project currently consists of the IPL communication library, a variety
of programming models, the Java Grid Application Toolkit (JavaGAT),
and the Zorilla peer-to-peer grid middleware.  All components can be
deployed on any grid platform, due to the use of Java.
</p>


<ul>
<li><b>IPL over UDP</b></li>

<p>
The IPL communication library was designed to be usable on multiple
different network substrates. Add a new IPL implementation capable of
communicating over the UDP protocol, avoiding the overheads caused by
the commonly used TCP.
</p>

<li><b>IPL over Bluetooth</b></li>

<p>
The IPL communication library was designed to be usable on multiple
different network substrates. Add a new IPL implementation capable of
communicating over the Bluetooth protocol, allowing efficient
wireless communication.
</p>

<li><b>The Multimedia PowerGrid</b></li>

<p>
The extraction of information (knowledge) from image and video data is a 
challenging and computationally demanding task. To run image and video 
processing applications on large-scale Grid systems, many inherent Grid 
complexities need to be overcome. One major complexity is the problem of 
system heterogeneity.
</p>

<p>
Virtualization is a popular way of reducing the problem of the Grid's 
heterogeneity. The technique has been applied in several application 
environments (e.g. VMware, .NET) and programming languages (e.g. Java, 
Perl, Python). From these, Java seems to have become the most widely 
adopted. As Java has been shown to provide competitive performance in 
comparison with C/C++, it seems a relevant language for implementing 
large-scale image and video processing applications.
</p>

<p>
In this project you will implement a small parallel image processing 
library in Java and Ibis (on the basis of an existing library in C++ and 
MPI). The functionality is to be applied in one or more parallel 
image/video processing applications (several examples of which we have 
available). The applications are to be run on a set of cluster systems, 
potentially at a world-wide scale. The resulting system in Java is to be 
evaluated by comparing the obtained results with the original C++/MPI 
system.
</p>

<a href="http://www.cs.vu.nl/~fjseins/">Dr. Frank J. Seinstra</a>.
</p>

<li><b>Awari in Ibis (challenging)</b></li>

<p>
Develop an Ibis program that computes all possible moves in the
board game Awari.
We have an existent and very efficient implementation in C++ plus
assembly code for some `hotspots'. The challenge is to re-implement the
program using the Ibis library. This would result in a much more portable
and `grid-aware' program.
</p>
<p>
However, since the original implementation used a number of machine-specific
tricks to get a solution in a reasonable time, and since most of these
tricks will not be feasible in the new environment,
an entirely
different solution strategy may be necessary.

<h3><a name="m-saga">SAGA (and JavaGAT)</a></h3>
<p>
<a href="http://saga.cct.lsu.edu/">SAGA</a> is the Simple API for Grid 
Applications, a standard we have developed within the Open Grid Forum
<a href="http://www.ogf.org">(OGF)</a>. SAGA is supposed to be a successor
of the Grid Application Toolkit (GAT) that is
more focused to application needs.
</p>
<p>
Our group has built a SAGA implementation in the Java language, using the
JavaGAT as an underlying interface to middleware.
In the context of the SAGA/JavaGAT combination, we have a few topics available.
</p>

<ul>
<li><b>One SAGA for all</b></li>
<p>
So far, there exist two SAGA implementations, one in the Java language,
and one in C++. Ideally, programs written in any programming language should
be able to use SAGA's functionality. To come close to this goal, we propose
to use the SAGA implementation in C++ and to turn it into a server process 
that accepts calls from localhost using
<a href="http://www.xmlrpc.com">XML-RPC</a> for which client implementations
exist for many, many languages.
</p>
<p>Please contact
<a href="http://www.cs.vu.nl/~kielmann/">Thilo Kielmann</a>.</p>

<li><b>Adaptors for OGF's OGSA-based services</b></li>
<p>
Recently, implementations of the OGSA BES (basic execution service) and
BYTE-IO have become available, such as 
<a href="http://www.cs.virginia.edu/~vcgr/wiki/index.php/The_Genesis_II_Project">Genesis II</a> form the University of Virginia.
Coupling Genesis II with SAGA (via the JavaGAT)
would provide an important evaluation of OGF standards.
</p>
<p>Please contact
<a href="http://www.cs.vu.nl/~kielmann/">Thilo Kielmann</a>.</p>

<li><b>Adaptors for Condor</b></li>
<p>
<a href="http://www.cs.wisc.edu/condor/">Condor</a> is a widely used 
middleware to submit computational jobs to, focusing on high-throughput 
computing.
Coupling Condor with SAGA (via the JavaGAT)
would provide an important extension of the SAGA/JavaGAT scope.

<h3><a name="m-misc">Miscellaneous</a></h3>

<ul>
<li><b>Grid implementation of the coordination language Reo</b></li>

<p>
The IPL communication library was designed to be usable on multiple
different network substrates. Add a new IPL implementation capable of
communicating over the UDP protocol, avoiding the overheads caused by
the commonly used TCP.
</p>

<p>
The coordination language Reo offers a model of concurrency where
interaction constitutes the only first-class concept.
</p>

<p>
In the connector calculus that underlies Reo, every connector denotes
a concrete interaction (protocol). Simple composition rules in Reo
allow construction of arbitrarily complex protocols out of a handful
of primitive protocols embodied in connectors, called channels. A
concurrent application in Reo consists of a number of active entities
(threads or processes) that anonymously communicate with each other
through connectors. Reo enforces a strict separation of communication
and computation, which makes the semantics of a connector independent of
the semantics of the active entities that it interconnects. This supports
scalable compositional construction of massively concurrent systems.
Reo derives its high expressiveness from its unique feature of allowing
arbitrary combination of exclusion, synchrony, and asynchrony in a single
coherent compositional model. The semantics of Reo exists in various
formal models, each serving a different purpose, e.g., correctness
proofs, reasoning about various properties of connectors, model checking,
(centralized and distributed) implementation, etc.
</p>

<p>
The goal of this project is to use Reo connectors to compose and
coordinate Grid services, using the IPL. The scheme involves creating a
local Java thread as a proxy for each remote Grid service.  Creation of
these proxies must be as mechanical and automated as possible, given
the formal definitions of their interfaces and behavior.  Communication
between a proxy and its corresponding Grid service will use the IPL
library.  Formal parameters of types inPort and outPort objects that
support get and put operations provide the only means of communication
between a proxy and Reo connectors.
</p>

<p>
To generate executable code from graphical specification of Reo circuits,
we use constraint automata as an intermediary representation. Algorithms
exist to compositionally derive the constraint automaton of a Reo circuit
from the constraint automata of its constituent channels. Programs
also exist to automate this process and to generate Java code from
the resulting automata.  These tools exist as plug-ins in the Eclipse
environment. The focus of this project is to devise effective schemes
for construction of local-thread proxies for Grid services using the IPL,
and the necessary Eclipse tools and plug-ins to semi-automate their
generation integration with Reo.
</p>

<p>
Implement the multi-threaded shared-memory version of Reo on top IPL,
giving a working but probably far-for-efficient distributed implementation
of Reo.

<li><b>Poker player (challenging)</b></li>

<p>
Develop a computer poker player that approximates or exceeds state-of-the-art
implementations. <b>Note:</b> this project requires some literature study,
and may not even be feasible in the current form.
</p>

<li><b>Optimal code generation (challenging)</b></li>

<p>
Develop a program that generates for a small code fragment the <em>optimal</em>
code sequence, by doing an exhaustive search. <b>Note:</b> this project requires
some literature study,
and may not even be feasible in the current form.

<p>
Some smaller or non-scientific projects, suitable, for example, for
an Individual Programming Assignment for PDCS students.
</p>


<ul>
<li><b>Shared memory for grid applications (C++ && C)</b></li>

The Simple API for Grid Applications (SAGA) is an open standard that
defines a high-level, object-oriented interface to grid functionality
(e.g. job submission, file access etc.) SAGA is used in the XtreemOS
project, which aims to develop a linux-based operating system
specifically designed for grids. A subproject within XtreemOS is the
Object Sharing Service (OSS), a C-library that provides shared memory
with various consistency models to distributed applications.

In this IPA, you will add the functionality of OSS to the C++ reference
implementation of SAGA. The end goal is to have an object-oriented
interface to distributed shared memory, which will be added to the
XtreemOS distribution.

</ul>

<li><b>Job submission in XtreemOS (Java)</b></li>

The Simple API for Grid Applications (SAGA) is an open standard that
defines a high-level, object-oriented interface to grid functionality
(e.g. job submission, file access etc.). SAGA interacts with different
kinds of middleware using plugins called 'adaptors'. SAGA is used in the
XtreemOS project, which aims to develop a linux-based operating system
specifically designed for grids. Among other things, XtreemOS provides
its own job submission system.

In this IPA, you will implement a job adaptor for the Java
implementation of SAGA that interacts with the job submission system of
XtreemOS. The end goal is to be able to submit jobs to XtreemOS nodes
from a Java application using SAGA.

<li><b>JavaGAT SRB adaptor</b></li>

The JavaGAT is currently somewhat low on storage adaptors. An adaptor
for the 
<a href="http://www.sdsc.edu/srb/index.php/Main_Page">
Storage Resource Broker(SRB)</a> 
system would help to fill this gap.

Quote from the SRB website:
"The Storage Resource Broker (SRB) is a Data Grid Management System
(DGMS) or simply a logical distributed file system based on a
client-server architecture which presents the user with a single global
logical namespace or file hierarchy."

</ul>
