<h2>Smartsockets</h2>

<p>Tightly coupled parallel applications are increasingly run in grid
environments. Unfortunately, on many grid sites the ability of machines to
create or accept network connections is severely limited by firewalls, network
address translation (NAT) or non-routed networks. Multi homing further
complicates connection setup and machine identification.  Although ad-hoc
solutions exist for some of these problems, it is usually up to the
application's user to discover the cause of the connectivity problems and find
a solution. The SmartSockets communication library lifts this burden by
automatically discovering the connectivity problems and  solving them with as
little support from the user as possible.</p>
