<h2>Zorilla</h2>

<p>Zorilla is peer-to-peer grid middleware. It implements all functionality needed to run applications on a grid in a fully distributed manner, such as scheduling, file transfer and security. Deployment of Zorilla is easy; only a single application needs to be installed on the participating machines. Zorilla requires little configuration, since machines automatically organize themselves into a grid. Due to its peer-to-peer design, Zorilla scales to large numbers of machines.  Jobs can be submitted to Zorilla directly or using the JavaGAT. Although Zorilla was explicitly designed to support supercomputing applications, it is possible to run any type of application.</p>
