<h4>JavaGAT 2.0.1 released</h4> 

<p>JavaGAT 2.0.1 is a bug-fix release of JavaGAT 2.0. It contains the following
changes with respect to version 2.0:</p>

<ul> 
    <li>GlobusFileAdaptor: renameTo failed if the passed URI wasn't on the same
    host as the file. (Bug reported by Alexander Beck-Ratzka)</li>

    <li>LogicalFileCpi: underlying storage of the files belonging to the
    logicalfile is now done in a Vector and is synchronized (previously it
    wasn't synchronized in an ArrayList). (Bug reported by Enric Tejedor) </li>

    <li> javagat.properties: updated to reflect all preferences and their
    defaults.  </li>

    <li> GliteAdaptor: added a GliteAdaptor developed by Thomas Zangerl (Thanks
    a lot!) </li>

    <li> added support for preference <"job.stop.poststage", true|false> which
    controls whether the job should poststage if the stop method is invoked on
    this job. (request from Keith Cover) </li>

    <li> FileCpi: improved method recursiveDeleteDirectory, it only does
    recursive delete if a direct delete fails, this can speed up poststaging
    and sandbox removal quite a lot.  </li>

    <li> LocalResourceBroker: fixed accessing of the path of the sandbox (Bug
    reported by Hans-Martin Adorf) </li>

    <li> GlobusFileAdaptor: mkdir failed if preference file.chmod wasn't set,
    it did set the mode to 000, now it takes the umask on the remote machine as
    default (Bug reported by Hans-Martin Adorf and others) </li>
</ul>

<h4>Press Release: Ibis wins Data Analysis Challenge for Finding
    Supernovae</h4> 

<p>In August 2008 two Ibis teams (both from the Computer Systems group of Prof.
Henri Bal, VU University, Amsterdam) have won the first prize in the "First
International Data Analysis Challenge for Finding Supernovae". The competition
was organized in conjunction with the IEEE Cluster/Grid 2008 Conference, held
from September 29 to October 1 in Tsukuba, Japan (see: <a
    href="http://www.cluster2008.org/challenge/">http://www.cluster2008.org/challenge/</a>).
The goal of the competition was to promote efficient data analysis techniques
that can be applied to large-scale and distributed networks of supercomputer
systems.</p>

<p>In the competition an enormous distributed database of scientific data,
which was gathered by the Subaru telescope in Hawaii, had to be searched to
find so-called 'supernova candidates'. A supernova is a phenomenon in which a
star explodes in a spectacular manner, causing a very large mount of light to
be emitted. For the calculation of the supernova candidates all fourteen
candidates had a supercomputer system at their disposal comprising of 12
computer clusters distributed over Japan.</p>

<p>The competition consisted of two categories: <br />
(1) the 'basic' category,
in which the goal was to perform all of the necessary calculations as fast as
possible. <br />
(2) the 'fault-tolerant' category, in which the goal was to
perform all calculations as fast as possible, but with the added complexity of
having one or more of the calculation processes killed by the organizers of the
competition. <br />
Both categories represent realistic scenarios that play an
important role in computing at a very large scale.</p>

<p>The first VU-team, called 'Ibis Stargazers', led by Dr. Jason Maassen, and
further comprising of Dr. Frank Seinstra, Dr. Rob van Nieuwpoort, Drs. Niels
Drost, and Roelof Kemp, has won the competition in the basic category by
obtaining by far the fastest result. While the VU-team required only 36 minutes
for all calculations, the second best team used up more than 1 hour. All other
teams obtained run-times of 3 to even more than 25 times longer. In addition,
only half of all teams were capable of completing the challenge in this
category at all. </p>

<p>The second VU-team, called 'IbisNovae', comprising of Dr. Kees van Reeuwijk,
has won the competition in the 'fault tolerance' category, using about 49
minutes of calculation time. This achievement is particularly remarkable 
as no other team was capable of completing the task in this category at all.
This is because, in the research field, the provisioning of solutions to fault
tolerance is known to be a very hard problem.</p>

<p>The success of the
two teams is largely due to the Ibis Grid Programming and Deployment System
(see <a href="http://www.cs.vu.nl/ibis">http://www.cs.vu.nl/ibis/</a>), which has been
developed at the VU University in recent years. Ibis greatly simplifies the
writing of computer programs for large-scale and distributed applications, by
hiding virtually all of the underlying software and hardware  complexities. The
success in this Data Analysis Challenge is also not the only one: earlier this
year a VU-team has won the first prize in the 'First IEEE International
Scalable Computing Challenge', held in conjunction with CCGrid'08 in Lyon,
France. This earlier result was also obtained with a software system that was
implemented using Ibis. </p>
