<h1>Student projects, Ibis and more</h1>
<p>
This page contains available projects for VU students, as currently
offered by the group of prof. Henri Bal and Dr. Thilo Kielmann.
As many of our activities have to do with the Ibis project, this page
is located here. Nevertheless, also other topics (from the area of
high-performance distributed computing) can be found here.
Please check out the category of project you are interested in:

<h2>Student projects</h2>
<p>
VU students who want to help us develop new features for Ibis are
very welcome.  Within our ongoing research work, we frequently have
open sub-problems that can be assigned to students as Bachelor or Master
thesis projects. Literature studies and individual programming
assignments are often also available.
Have a look at the projects on this page, and see if there is anything
that matches your skills.

<h3>Open Topics</h3>

<p>
The following open topics are grouped by projects or topic area.
The following descriptions merely indicate topics; the exact definition
of a Master project will be negotiated with the individual student,
to match interests and also the size of 36 ECTS credit points per project.
For other types of projects (like an Individual Programming Assignment
for PDCS students), size and orientation of a project can be varied.

<h3>Ibis: Efficient Java Based Grid Computing</h3>

<p>
<a href="http://www.cs.vu.nl/ibis">The Ibis project</a>
is creating an efficient, Java-based platform for grid computing. The Ibis
project currently consists of the IPL communication library, a variety
of programming models, the Java Grid Application Toolkit (JavaGAT),
and the Zorilla peer-to-peer grid middleware.  All components can be
deployed on any grid platform, due to the use of Java.
</p>

<ul>
<li><b>IPL over UDP</b></li>

<p>
The IPL communication library was designed to be usable on multiple
different network substrates. Add a new IPL implementation capable of
communicating over the UDP protocol, avoiding the overheads caused by
the commonly used TCP.
</p>

<li><b>IPL over Bluetooth</b></li>

<p>
The IPL communication library was designed to be usable on multiple
different network substrates. Add a new IPL implementation capable of
communicating over the Bluetooth protocol, allowing efficient
wireless communication.
</p>

<li><b>The Multimedia PowerGrid</b></li>

<p>
The extraction of information (knowledge) from image and video data is a 
challenging and computationally demanding task. To run image and video 
processing applications on large-scale Grid systems, many inherent Grid 
complexities need to be overcome. One major complexity is the problem of 
system heterogeneity.
</p>

<p>
Virtualization is a popular way of reducing the problem of the Grid's 
heterogeneity. The technique has been applied in several application 
environments (e.g. VMware, .NET) and programming languages (e.g. Java, 
Perl, Python). From these, Java seems to have become the most widely 
adopted. As Java has been shown to provide competitive performance in 
comparison with C/C++, it seems a relevant language for implementing 
large-scale image and video processing applications.
</p>

<p>
In this project you will implement a small parallel image processing 
library in Java and Ibis (on the basis of an existing library in C++ and 
MPI). The functionality is to be applied in one or more parallel 
image/video processing applications (several examples of which we have 
available). The applications are to be run on a set of cluster systems, 
potentially at a world-wide scale. The resulting system in Java is to be 
evaluated by comparing the obtained results with the original C++/MPI 
system.

<li><b>Grid implementation of the coordination language Reo</b></li>

<p>
The IPL communication library was designed to be usable on multiple
different network substrates. Add a new IPL implementation capable of
communicating over the UDP protocol, avoiding the overheads caused by
the commonly used TCP.
</p>

<p>
The coordination language Reo offers a model of concurrency where
interaction constitutes the only first-class concept.
</p>

<p>
In the connector calculus that underlies Reo, every connector denotes
a concrete interaction (protocol). Simple composition rules in Reo
allow construction of arbitrarily complex protocols out of a handful
of primitive protocols embodied in connectors, called channels. A
concurrent application in Reo consists of a number of active entities
(threads or processes) that anonymously communicate with each other
through connectors. Reo enforces a strict separation of communication
and computation, which makes the semantics of a connector independent of
the semantics of the active entities that it interconnects. This supports
scalable compositional construction of massively concurrent systems.
Reo derives its high expressiveness from its unique feature of allowing
arbitrary combination of exclusion, synchrony, and asynchrony in a single
coherent compositional model. The semantics of Reo exists in various
formal models, each serving a different purpose, e.g., correctness
proofs, reasoning about various properties of connectors, model checking,
(centralized and distributed) implementation, etc.
</p>

<p>
The goal of this project is to use Reo connectors to compose and
coordinate Grid services, using the IPL. The scheme involves creating a
local Java thread as a proxy for each remote Grid service.  Creation of
these proxies must be as mechanical and automated as possible, given
the formal definitions of their interfaces and behavior.  Communication
between a proxy and its corresponding Grid service will use the IPL
library.  Formal parameters of types inPort and outPort objects that
support get and put operations provide the only means of communication
between a proxy and Reo connectors.
</p>

<p>
To generate executable code from graphical specification of Reo circuits,
we use constraint automata as an intermediary representation. Algorithms
exist to compositionally derive the constraint automaton of a Reo circuit
from the constraint automata of its constituent channels. Programs
also exist to automate this process and to generate Java code from
the resulting automata.  These tools exist as plug-ins in the Eclipse
environment. The focus of this project is to devise effective schemes
for construction of local-thread proxies for Grid services using the IPL,
and the necessary Eclipse tools and plug-ins to semi-automate their
generation integration with Reo.
</p>

<p>
Implement the multi-threaded shared-memory version of Reo on top IPL,
giving a working but probably far-for-efficient distributed implementation
of Reo.
</p>


<li><b>Awari in Ibis (challenging)</b></li>

<p>
Develop an Ibis program that computes all possible moves in the
board game Awari.
We have an existent and very efficient implementation in C++ plus
assembly code for some `hotspots'. The challenge is to re-implement the
program using the Ibis library. This would result in a much more portable
and `grid-aware' program.
</p>
<p>
However, since the original implementation used a number of machine-specific
tricks to get a solution in a reasonable time, and since most of these
tricks will not be feasible in the new environment,
an entirely
different solution strategy may be necessary. 
</p>

<li><b>Poker player (challenging)</b></li>

<p>
Develop a computer poker player that approximates or exceeds state-of-the-art
implementations. <b>Note:</b> this project requires some literature study,
and may not even be feasible in the current form.
</p>

<li><b>Optimal code generation (challenging)</b></li>

<p>
Develop a program that generates for a small code fragment the <em>optimal</em>
code sequence, by doing an exhaustive search. <b>Note:</b> this project requires
some literature study,
and may not even be feasible in the current form.

<h2><a name="bsc">Bachelor Projects</a></h2>

<p>
See the <a href="http://www.few.vu.nl/onderwijs/bachelors/inf/bachelorproject.html">overview</a> for general information.
We can generally come up with assignments that explore certain aspects
of grid computing or related subjects.
This means that your thesis would not just be written for getting 
the grade and immediate disposal in the trash...

<h4>Open Topics</h4>

There are currently no open topics, but that doesn't

<h2><a name="ipa">Individual programming assignments</a></h2>

<p>
Some smaller or non-scientific projects, suitable, for example, for
an Individual Programming Assignment for PDCS students.

<ul>
<li><b>JavaGAT SRB adaptor</b></li>

The JavaGAT is currently somewhat low on storage adaptors. An adaptor
for the 
<a href="http://www.sdsc.edu/srb/index.php/Main_Page">
Storage Resource Broker(SRB)</a> 
system would help to fill this gap.

Quote from the SRB website:
"The Storage Resource Broker (SRB) is a Data Grid Management System
(DGMS) or simply a logical distributed file system based on a
client-server architecture which presents the user with a single global
logical namespace or file hierarchy."

</ul>
