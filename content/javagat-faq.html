<p><strong>Question: Will middleware 'xxx' be supported?<br /> </strong>
Answer: JavaGAT is a very flexible toolkit an can support any middleware. The
default JavaGAT release comes with a lot of adaptors, but if the one that's
installed on your cluster isn't available, you have to implement it yourself.
Please let us know when you created a new adaptor. It might be included in new
JavaGAT releases. </p>
