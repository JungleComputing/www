<h3>The Ibis Philosophy</h3>

<p>
Although grids hold great promise for many scientific applications, writing
efficient and portable grid applications is notoriously difficult. Grid
programmers often have to use low-level programming interfaces that change
frequently, and they have to deal with heterogeneity, connectivity problems,
and fault tolerance. Also, managing a running application is complicated,
because the execution environment changes dynamically, as resources come and
go.
</p>

<p>The Ibis project aims to drastically simplify the programming and deployment
process of high-performance grid applications. The Ibis philosophy is that grid
applications should be developed on a local workstation and simply be launched
from there. This write-and-go philosophy requires minimalistic assumptions
about the execution environment, and sends most of the environment&#39;s
software (e.g., libraries) along with the application. The Ibis system is
designed to run in a hostile grid environment that is dynamic, heterogeneous,
and suffers from connectivity problems. </p>

<h3>Subprojects of Ibis</h3>

</p>

<p>The Ibis project consists of a number of subprojects. All projects are Java,
open source (BSD-like license), and downloadable from this website.  The Ibis
subproject can be used independently, or in combination with one or more other
subprojects. Also, all Ibis software can be combined with existing software,
including native code.</p>
