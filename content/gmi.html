<h2>Group Method Invocation(GMI)</h2>

<p>The Group Method Invocation (GMI) model is a generalization of Java's Remote Method Invocation (RMI). It allows methods to be invoked either on a single object or a group of objects, the latter possibly with personalized parameters. Result values and exceptions can be returned normally (as with RMI), discarded, or, when multiple results are produced, combined into a single result. The different method invocation and reply handling schemes can be combined orthogonally, allowing us to express a large spectrum of communication mechanisms of which RMI and MPI-style collective communication are special cases. With GMI, the invocation and reply schemes can be selected for each method individually at run time. GMI is described <a href= "http://www.cs.vu.nl/~jason/papers/LNCS.ps.gz">here</a>.</p>
