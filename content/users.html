<h2>Ibis users</h2>

<p>Below we list some users of Ibis. We are always interested in users expericence with
Ibis and are more than happy to add any projects which uses Ibis to this page. </p>


<h3>MaRVIN:a distributed platform for massive RDF inference</h3>

<p>The <a href="http://www.cs.vu.nl/en/sec/ai/kr/">Knowledge Representation and
    Reasoning Group</a> of the Vrije Universiteit uses the Ibis Portability
Layer to implement their <a href="http://www.larkc.eu/marvin/">MaRVIN</a>
system for distibuted RDF inference. Their submission to the <a
    href="http://challenge.semanticweb.org/">Billion Triple Challenge</a> using
this software won 3rd place</p>

<p><strong>From the Marvin Page:</strong> We have built MaRVIN (Massive RDF Versatile Inference
Network), a parallel and distributed platform for performing RDF(S) inference
on a network of loosely coupled machines using a peer-to-peer model. MaRVIN can
be scaled to arbitrary size by adding computing nodes to the network, is robust
against failure of individual components, and displays anytime behaviour
(producing results incrementally over time). MaRVIN is not built as a single
reasoner, but rather as a platform for experimenting with different reasoning
strategies. MaRVIN contains instrumentation to log and visualise its run-time
behaviour, and its modular design allows to vary different aspects of the
reasoning strategy.</p>


<h3>Parallel simulation of soil-structure-interaction</h3>

    class="userlogo" width="150" alt= "iib logo" ></a>

<a href="http://www.iib.bauing.tu-darmstadt.de/mitarbeiter/mueller.html">Michael
    Mueller</a> of the <a
    href="http://www.iib.bauing.tu-darmstadt.de/">Institute of Numerical
    Methods and Informatics in Civil Engineering</a> is implementing an
Intra-Grid-System for the parallel simulation of soil-structure-interaction
for geotechnical problems.</p>

<p>The constitutive equations are described by the theory of porous media,
where the interaction between the involved phases is considered. The
averaging of the phases over a representive elementary volume is carried out
using the concept of volumetric content. The complexity and size of
three-dimensional engineering-problems in the field of fluid-soil-interaction
makes the simulation numerically very costly, especially when the results are
to be improved by fully-adaptive methods. In our project we apply the
fully-adaptive p-refinement of the FEM.</p>

<p>The parallelization is based on mobile Java-Agents, taking advantage of
the agent features such as portability, mobility, reactivity etc. In the time
critical parts of the parallel simulation, mainly the solving of the linear
equation system, we use Ibis for a more efficient communication, solving the
problem of the very slow agent-based messaging. Ibis offers all features
needed for an efficient and trouble-free implementation, such as one-2-many
communication and the possiblity to send arbitrary objects.</p>

<p>The numerical part of the simulation works reasonably well and at present
we are mainly dealing with aspects of load balancing and job-scheduling.</p>

<h3>ProActive</h3>

<p><a href="http://www-sop.inria.fr/oasis/proactive"><img
    src="http://www-sop.inria.fr/oasis/proactive/images/pro-active2.gif"
    width="150" class="userlogo" alt="ProActive logo"></a>ProActive is a GRID
Java library for parallel, distributed, and concurrent computing, also
featuring mobility and security in a uniform framework. With a reduced set of
simple primitives, ProActive provides a comprehensive API allowing to
simplify the programming of applications that are distributed on Local Area
Network (LAN), on cluster of workstations, or on Internet Grids. See the <a
    href= "http://www-sop.inria.fr/oasis/proactive/">ProActive website</a>
for more information.</p>

<p>ProActive has been ported to Ibis by <a href=
    "http://www-sop.inria.fr/oasis/personnel/Fabrice.Huet/">Fabrice Huet</a>.
<a href= "http://www-sop.inria.fr/oasis/personnel/Laurent.Baduel/">Laurent
    Baduel</a> used this version for a Java version of EM3D: a parallel
solver for electromagnetic waves propagation. Performance results are
presented in Section 6.4.3 of <a href=
    "http://www-sop.inria.fr/oasis/personnel/Laurent.Baduel/TypedGroupsForTheGrid.pdf">his
    thesis</a>.</p>

<h3>MEG scanner data processing</h3>

<p><a name="VuMC" id="VuMC"></a> The Vrije Universiteit Medical Centre (VUmc)
posesses a MEG scanner which produces lots of data which must be processed.
Magnetoencephalography (MEG) is a tool to study the function of the human
brain. MEG measures the magnetic field intensity at hundreds of points over
the surface of the skull up to several thousand times per second.
Measurements made while a subject is recognizing a picture, performing
mathematical calculations, watching an alternating check board pattern,
sitting quietly with their eyes closed, or a host of other tasks, provide
insight into the functioning of the brain, whether healthy or diseased.  </p>

<p>The size of a data set from one session with one subject is often hundreds
of megabytes.  When this is multiplied by dozens of subjects in a study, and
perhaps multiple sessions per subject, the computational demands become
arduous and clustered computer resources are often necessary.  As our
processing code is written in Java, the Ibis ability to move hundreds of
megabytes to many different nodes very quickly, simply and efficiently is a
great advantage.  Once a copy of a data set is on the local hard disk of a
node, processing of the data becomes much quicker and easier.</p>

<h3>Jylab</h3>
<p><a href="http://scgroup2.ceid.upatras.gr:8000/JylabHomepage"><img src="http://scgroup2.ceid.upatras.gr:8000/wiki/common/jylab.jpg" width="150" class="userlogo" alt="Jylab logo"></a>
Jylab is a portable and flexible scientific computing environment. At minimum,
it provides a user with a scripting language and a core set of libraries implementing
numerical linear algebra routines (NLA) and communication models.
The communication models are provided by Ibis.
Jylab thus enables the development of scientific applications over distributed
computing platforms.</p>

<p>Jylab owes its portability to <a href="http://www.jython.org">Jython</a>.
Jython is an implementation of the
Python programming language written in Java. So Jylab runs at all platforms providing
a recent JVM. Also it is flexible enough, since one normally programs in Python,
which is a very high-level, object-oriented, dynamically-typed language.</p>

<h3>A Grid-wide file system</h3>

<p>Sasha Ruppert from the Universität Erlangen-Nürnberg in Erlangen,
Germany built a Grid-wide file system using Ibis as the communication
layer. Click <a href="http://www2.cs.fau.de/Lehre/SA-DA/GridFileSystem.xml">here</a> for more information.</p>

<h3>The KOALA grid scheduler</h3>
<p><a href="http://www.st.ewi.tudelft.nl/koala/">KOALA</a> is a grid
scheduler that has been designed, implemented, and deployed by the
<a href="http://www.pds.ewi.tudelft.nl/">PDS</a> group in Delft on the
<a href="http://www.cs.vu.nl/das2">DAS-2</a> multicluster system in the
context of the
<a href="http://www.vl-e.nl/">Virtual Lab for e-Science (VL-e)</a>
research project. The main feature of KOALA is its support for co-allocation,
that is, the simultaneous allocation of resources in multiple clusters of
the DAS to single applications which consist of multiple components.
Ibis has been used for many of the KOALA scheduling experiments.
