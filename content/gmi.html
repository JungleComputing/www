<h2>Group Method Invocation(GMI)</h2>

<p>
The Group Method Invocation (GMI) model is a generalization of Java's
Remote Method Invocation (RMI). It allows methods to be invoked either
on a single object or a group of objects, the latter possibly with
personalized parameters. Result values and exceptions can be returned
normally (as with RMI), discarded, or, when multiple results are produced,
combined into a single result. The different method invocation and reply
handling schemes can be combined orthogonally, allowing us to express a
large spectrum of communication mechanisms of which RMI and MPI-style
collective communication are special cases. With GMI, the invocation and
reply schemes can be selected for each method individually at run time.
GMI is described <a href="publications.html#gmi">here</a>.
