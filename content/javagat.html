Java Grid Application Toolkit (JavaGAT) offers a set of
coordinated, generic and flexible APIs for accessing grid services
from application codes, portals, data managements systems, etc.</p>

<p>JavaGAT sits between grid applications and numerous types of
grid middleware, such as Globus, Glite, SGE, SSH or Zorilla. JavaGAT
lifts the burden of grid application programmers by providing them
with a uniform interface that provides:</p>
<ul>
    <li>file operations (File, LogicalFile, RandomAccessFile, Endpoint)</li>
    <li>file stream operations (FileInputStream, FileOutputStream)</li>
    <li>job submission (ResourceBroker)</li>
    <li>monitoring (Monitorable)</li>
    <li>access to information services (AdvertService)</li>
</ul>
<p>
As a result, grid
application programmers need only to learn a single API to obtain access
to the entire grid. Due to its modular design, JavaGAT can easily
be extended with support for other grid middleware layers.</p>

<p>The structure of JavaGAT is shown in the picture on the right.</p>

<p>
The idea is that grid applications do not use grid middleware directly. Instead, the applications calls methods of the GAT API.
The GAT engine dynamically "routes" the API calls to the correct grid middleware.
</p>

<p>We have plugins (called adaptors) for many different grid middleware systems.
The following table lists the adaptors that come with the standard JavaGAT distribution.
All adaptors are implemented in java, and libraries that are needed are included in the distribution.
JavaGAT does not rely on any pre installed external packages or libraries.
