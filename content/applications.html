Below we list applications developed for Ibis at the Vrije Universiteit. See the <a href="users.html">users section</a> for applications developed by others.

<h3>SAT4SATIN</h3>

<p>The satisfiability problem (SAT), i.e., the problem deciding whether
a given boolean formula is satisfiable, is an important NP-complete problem.
The solution of a SAT problem is either a boolean variable assignment
that makes the given formula true, or the result "unsatisfiable" meaning
that no such assignment exists. Solving a SAT problem requires a systematic
search over a potentially huge solution space. Various techniques have been
developed to make this search more efficient for practical problems, but it is
inherently difficult. Satisfiability solvers are commonly used in industry
to verify the correctness of complex digital circuits, such as out-of-order
execution units in modern processors.</p>

<p>We constructed an efficient SAT solver "SAT4SATIN" based on the existing
sequential solver <a href="http://www.sat4j.org">SAT4J</a>, which in turn is a
reimplementation in Java of <a href="http://www.cs.chalmers.se/Cs/Research/FormalMethods/MiniSat/">MiniSAT</a>.
Both MiniSAT and SAT4J are "industry strength" solvers, that are competitive
with other state-of-the-art implementations. These solvers use a backtracking
search that speculatively assigns boolean values to variables until the problem
is satisfied or a conflict is encountered. Upon a conflict the solver
backtracks.</p>

<p>Parallelizing SAT4J with Satin was relatively easy. For each speculative
assignment a task is spawned so that alternative assignments are evaluated
in parallel.
A challenging issue in parallelizing SAT solvers arises from the
fact that it is hard to predict how much execution time is needed to
solve a spawned subproblem. For some subproblems, the costs of
spawning may even exceed the execution time. Therefore, in our
implementation we use the same approach taken in the 
<a href="http://vgrads.rice.edu/research/applications/gridsat">GridSAT</a> solver: each task
first performs a certain amount of sequential search before splitting
up the remaining search problem. This guarantees that only hard
tasks will be split.</p>

<p>Other aspects that are implemented conveniently and efficiently
using a recent shared objects extension include global learning and
global search bound checking.</p>
