<h2>Satin</h2>

Satin extends Java with Cilk like primitives, that make it very convenient for
the programmer to write divide and conquer style programs. Unlike
manager/worker programs, divide-and-conquer algorithms operate by recursively
dividing a problem into smaller subproblems. This recursive subdivision goes on
until the remaining subproblem becomes trivial to solve. After solving
subproblems, their results are recursively recombined until the final solution
is assembled.  Due to it's hierarchical nature, the divide-and-conquer model
maps cleanly to grid systems, which    also tend to have an hierarchical
structure. Satin contains a efficient and simple load-balancing algorithm,
Cluster-aware Random Stealing (CRS), which is shown to outperform existing
load- balancing strategies on multi-cluster systems.  In addition, Satin also
provides efficient fault-tolerance, malleability (e.g. the ability to cope with
dynamically changing number of processors) and migration in a way that is
transparent to the application.
