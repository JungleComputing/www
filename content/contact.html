<p>If you like to contact us, please don't hesitate. We like to know about your
projects that are using (parts of) the Ibis project. In fact we're very
interested in what you're doing with using the Ibis software, because the more
users we have, the more funding we get and the more people are working on 
improving and maintaining Ibis. So please let us know! </p>

<p>You can contact the ibis team by sending an email to:  <script type="text/javascript"> generate_address_bare( "ibis", "cs.vu.nl" ); </script>.
