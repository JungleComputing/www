This release contains the following additions:
<ul>
<li>Shared objects for Satin. This is a replacement (and major improvement) of the TupleSpace, which was a hack, really. The TupleSpace is still there, but it is deprecated and will probably not be there anymore in the next Ibis release</li>
<li>Improved/rewritten connection setup code</li>
<li>Fixed various scalability issues, mostly in the nameserver. Ibis now scales up to at least a thousand nodes</li>
</ul>
