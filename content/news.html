<h4>IPL 2.2 released</h4>
<p>November 2009: Ibis Portability Layer (IPL) version 2.2 is now available!
For more information and downloads, see the <a href="ipl.html">IPL subproject page</a>.
</p>


<a name="javagat2.0.5"></a> 
<h4>JavaGAT 2.0.5 released</h4> 
<p>April 2009: JavaGAT 2.0.5 is now available from its
<a href="http://gforge.cs.vu.nl/gf/project/javagat/frs/?action=FrsReleaseView&release_id=132">downloads page</a>.
It is mostly a bug-fix release of JavaGAT 2.0.4, and contains a.o. the following
changes with respect to version 2.0.4:</p>
<ul>
<li> Alexander Beck-Ratzka contributed a Unicore resourcebroker adaptor.</li>
<li> The Ganymed sftp adaptor has been replaced with a Trilead sftp adaptor.</li>
<li> Removed sftp and sftpnew adaptors as they are obsoleted by the
Trilead sftp adaptor.</li>
<li> JavaGAT now uses slf4j as logging system. This means that you can use
your favorite logging system, as long as there is an slf4j implementation
for it. To accomplish that, you need to put the appropriate slf4j jar-file
in front of your classpath. If, like before, you want to use log4j, you
don't have to do anything, since this is the default.</li>
<li> The GATEngine now supports a "shared" jar-file directory, which allows
adaptors to share some of their dependencies, so that these are loaded
with the same classloader. This is useful for for instance security
objects that need to be shared by several adaptors.
See the file doc/adaptors/whySharedDirectory.txt.</li>
<li> There was an error in the unmarshal method of the LogicalFileCpi, which
made it impossible to unmarshal an advertized logicalfile.</li>
<li> There was a bug in the fixURI method of the FileCpi which sometimes made
it refer to a wrong location.</li>
<li> When staging in a file with an absolute source path and no explicit
destination, the file was staged to the wrong location (not the sandbox).</li>
<li> An explicit check for null job arguments was added, so that an exception
is thrown when the job description is created, instead of further on when
the job is run.</li>
<li> Fixed various problems in the Globus and FTP file adaptor. This is tricky
stuff because different servers behave differently! We have tested with
various servers, and it seems to work now, but your mileage may vary!</li>
<li> The Koala adaptor is now functional.
<li> The sshtrilead file adaptor sometimes failed because warnings were printed
on stderr. Now, these warnings are ignored (see bug #256).</li>
<li> Added a list method for the CommandlineSshFileAdaptor.</li>
<li> Protect executable and arguments against shell meta character expansion
in the Gridsam resource broker adaptor.</li>
<li> Some API has been added for file permissions. This basically is jdk7 stuff.
For now, gLite is the only adaptor that implements (some of) it.
org.gridlab.gat.io.File now has a method getFileAttributeView().</li>
<li> A special version of the GATEngine has been added for Android.</li>
<li> There has been a lot of development on the various gLite adaptors.</li>
<li> The Zorilla adaptor has been improved considerably.</li>

</ul>

<h4>JavaGAT 2.0.4 released</h4> 
<p>Februari 2009: JavaGAT 2.0.4 is now available from its
<a href="http://gforge.cs.vu.nl/gf/project/javagat/frs/?action=FrsReleaseView&release_id=124">downloads page</a>.
It is mostly a bug-fix release of JavaGAT 2.0.3, and contains a.o. the following
changes with respect to version 2.0.3:</p>
<ul>
    <li>fixed a couple of glitches in the tests.</li>
    <li>Glite adaptor: various updates and fixes, but according to the
    developers, its file adaptor is still to be considered "experimental".</li>
    <li>Globus File adaptor: various fixes.</li>
    <li>SshTrilead File adaptor: a couple of fixes for operations on
    non-existent files.
    Also, its getAbsolutePath() implementation was wrong.</li>
    <li>File.getName() returned null in some cases, which is a no-no.
    This is fixed, and this also fixes bug 187.</li>
    <li>re-implemented metrics administration. The old method maintained
    static lists inside GATEngine which were never cleaned up, so that there
    was a huge memory leak because the engine kept references to all jobs that
    were ever run. Now, the lists are maintained within the monitorable object
    itself and are no longer static. This fixes bug 134.</li>
    <li>(almost) all ResourceBroker adaptors: fixed stop() method:  the method
    may now be called in any job state, as promised in the javadoc.</li>
    <li>wsgt4new ResourceBroker adaptor: fixed to actually use a user-supplied
    credential (bug reported by Ralf Groeper).</li>
    <li>Sshtrilead and Commandlinessh ResourceBroker adaptors: fixed to prevent
    expansion of shell-meta-characters, and to make them work in case the
    shell on the server side is a C-shell
    (bug reported by Kees van Reeuwijk).</li>
    <li>fixed classloader issue: use either the classloader of the class that
    prompted the loading of JavaGAT or the context classloader, for the
    parent of the URL classloaders for the adaptors
    (bug reported by Ralf Groeper).</li>
    <li>fixed globus security utils: if the CredentialSecurityObject already
    contains a GSSCredential, just return that instead of ignoring it
    (bug reported by Ralf Groeper).</li>
    <li>fixed CommandRunner: now uses ProcessBuilder. This protects against
    local expansion of shell meta characters.</li>
    <li>Wsgt4new ResourceBroker Adaptor: sometimes gave redundant callbacks
    when the job was already finished, for instance, a redundant POST_STAGING
    callback, which caused overwriting of initially correct output files
    (bug reported by Brian Carpenter).<li>
    <li>fixed File.copy method to mimic cp -r behaviour when copying
    directories (copy dir a to b ended up as a copy b/a, even if b did not
    exist, now it only does so when a directory b exists, otherwise a
    directory b is created with copy of contents of a).</li>
    <li>LocalFileAdaptor: fixed bug 221 (getParentFile).</li>
    <li>Zorilla adaptor: various fixes.</li>
</ul>

<h4>MaRVIN Team wins 3rd prize at Billion Tripple track of Semantic Web Challenge 2008</h4>
<p>October 2008: The MaRVIN team used the Ibis Portability Layer to develop a self-organising distributed reasoner that can handle these large amounts of data. The MaRVIN system was demonstrated on the DAS-3 distributed supercomputer and was much appreciated for its innovative ideas, winning the 3rd prize in the Billion Triples track, see the <a href="http://www.cs.vu.nl/ibis/awards.html#MaRVIN">Awards</a> page.</p>

<h4>Smartsockets 1.4 released</h4>
<p>October 2008: Smartsockets 1.4 is now available from the downloads page. This is the first public release of Smartsockets.</p>

<a name="javagat2.0.1"></a> 
<h4>JavaGAT 2.0.1 released</h4> 

<p>JavaGAT 2.0.1 is a bug-fix release of JavaGAT 2.0. It contains the following
changes with respect to version 2.0:</p>

<ul> 
    <li>GlobusFileAdaptor: renameTo failed if the passed URI wasn't on the same
    host as the file. (Bug reported by Alexander Beck-Ratzka)</li>

    <li>LogicalFileCpi: underlying storage of the files belonging to the
    logicalfile is now done in a Vector and is synchronized (previously it
    wasn't synchronized in an ArrayList). (Bug reported by Enric Tejedor) </li>

    <li> javagat.properties: updated to reflect all preferences and their
    defaults.  </li>

    <li> GliteAdaptor: added a GliteAdaptor developed by Thomas Zangerl (Thanks
    a lot!) </li>

    <li> added support for preference <"job.stop.poststage", true|false> which
    controls whether the job should poststage if the stop method is invoked on
    this job. (request from Keith Cover) </li>

    <li> FileCpi: improved method recursiveDeleteDirectory, it only does
    recursive delete if a direct delete fails, this can speed up poststaging
    and sandbox removal quite a lot.  </li>

    <li> LocalResourceBroker: fixed accessing of the path of the sandbox (Bug
    reported by Hans-Martin Adorf) </li>

    <li> GlobusFileAdaptor: mkdir failed if preference file.chmod wasn't set,
    it did set the mode to 000, now it takes the umask on the remote machine as
    default (Bug reported by Hans-Martin Adorf and others) </li>
</ul>

<h4>Press Release: Ibis wins Data Analysis Challenge for Finding
    Supernovae</h4> 

<p>In August 2008 two Ibis teams (both from the Computer Systems group of Prof.
Henri Bal, VU University, Amsterdam) have won the first prize in the "First
International Data Analysis Challenge for Finding Supernovae". The competition
was organized in conjunction with the IEEE Cluster/Grid 2008 Conference, held
from September 29 to October 1 in Tsukuba, Japan (see: <a
    href="http://www.cluster2008.org/challenge/">http://www.cluster2008.org/challenge/</a>).
The goal of the competition was to promote efficient data analysis techniques
that can be applied to large-scale and distributed networks of supercomputer
systems.</p>

<p>In the competition an enormous distributed database of scientific data,
which was gathered by the Subaru telescope in Hawaii, had to be searched to
find so-called 'supernova candidates'. A supernova is a phenomenon in which a
star explodes in a spectacular manner, causing a very large mount of light to
be emitted. For the calculation of the supernova candidates all fourteen
candidates had a supercomputer system at their disposal comprising of 12
computer clusters distributed over Japan.</p>

<p>The competition consisted of two categories: <br />
(1) the 'basic' category,
in which the goal was to perform all of the necessary calculations as fast as
possible. <br />
(2) the 'fault-tolerant' category, in which the goal was to
perform all calculations as fast as possible, but with the added complexity of
having one or more of the calculation processes killed by the organizers of the
competition. <br />
Both categories represent realistic scenarios that play an
important role in computing at a very large scale.</p>

<p>The first VU-team, called 'Ibis Stargazers', led by Dr. Jason Maassen, and
further comprising of Dr. Frank Seinstra, Dr. Rob van Nieuwpoort, Drs. Niels
Drost, and Roelof Kemp, has won the competition in the basic category by
obtaining by far the fastest result. While the VU-team required only 36 minutes
for all calculations, the second best team used up more than 1 hour. All other
teams obtained run-times of 3 to even more than 25 times longer. In addition,
only half of all teams were capable of completing the challenge in this
category at all. </p>

<p>The second VU-team, called 'IbisNovae', comprising of Dr. Kees van Reeuwijk,
has won the competition in the 'fault tolerance' category, using about 49
minutes of calculation time. This achievement is particularly remarkable 
as no other team was capable of completing the task in this category at all.
This is because, in the research field, the provisioning of solutions to fault
tolerance is known to be a very hard problem.</p>

<p>The success of the
two teams is largely due to the Ibis Grid Programming and Deployment System
(see <a href="http://www.cs.vu.nl/ibis">http://www.cs.vu.nl/ibis/</a>), which has been
developed at the VU University in recent years. Ibis greatly simplifies the
writing of computer programs for large-scale and distributed applications, by
hiding virtually all of the underlying software and hardware  complexities. The
success in this Data Analysis Challenge is also not the only one: earlier this
year a VU-team has won the first prize in the 'First IEEE International
Scalable Computing Challenge', held in conjunction with CCGrid'08 in Lyon,
France. This earlier result was also obtained with a software system that was
implemented using Ibis. </p>

<p>The Ibis software system is freely downloadable from the Ibis website: <a
