<p>Communication libraries are used within parallel and distributed applications to communicate with other machines in the same computation. The Ibis project contains two such software projects:</p>

<dl>
    <dt>The Ibis Portability Layer(IPL)</dt>
    <dd>A generic, easy to use communication library for parallel and distributed applications, with explicit support for dynamic systems such as grids.</dd>

    <dt>SmartSockets</dt>
    <dd>An implementation of (Java) sockets which automatically takes care of any connectivity issues such as firewalls, NATs, non routed networks, multi homing, etc.</dd>
