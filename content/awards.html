<p>
Professor Henri Bal received the Euro-Par Achievement Award 2014.
Euro-Par is the major European conference series on parallel processing.
With the award, Euro-Par has yearly honoured one computer scientist since 2008.</p>
<p>
The 20th Euro-Par conference was held in Porto, Portugal, 25-29 August 2014,
and attracted almost 300 participants from all over the world.
Henri Bal gave a keynote presentation about the shared research infrastructure
for Dutch Computer Science, the Distributed ASCI Supercomputer, which is
organized by the ASCI research school.</p>
<p>
The award was presented by the chair of the Euro-Par Steering Committee,
Professor Christian Lengauer, in appreciation of Professor Bal's outstanding
and sustained contributions to parallel processing in the Netherlands and
beyond, including his research on parallel programming environments and his
work on the DAS infrastructure.

<h1>MaRVIN Team wins 3rd prize at Billion Triple track of Semantic Web Challenge 2008</h1>

<p>The <a href="http://challenge.semanticweb.org/">Semantic Web challenge</a>
is the premier international event for demonstrating practical progress towards
achieving the vision of the Semantic Web. The central idea of the Semantic Web
is to extend the current human-readable web by encoding some of the semantics
of resources in a machine-processable form. Moving beyond syntax opens the door
to more advanced applications and functionality on the Web. Computers will be
better able to search, process, integrate and present the content of these
resources in a meaningful, intelligent manner.</p>

<p>In 2008, the challenge for the first time included the "Billion Triple
track", whose primary goal is to demonstrate scalability of Semantic Web
architectures and applications.  The participants were given a collection of
one billion triples (single facts) and had to demonstrate added value from the
implicit semantics in the data. This could involve browsing and visualization
of the data, could include inferencing to add implicit information to the
dataset, etc.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://larkc.eu/marvin">MaRVIN</a> team used the Ibis
Portability Layer to develop a self-organising distributed reasoner that can
handle these large amounts of data. The MaRVIN system was demonstrated on the
DAS-3 distributed supercomputer and was much appreciated for its innovative
ideas, winning the 3rd prize in the Billion Triples track.</p>

    href="http://www.cluster2008.org/challenge/">DACH 2008</a>, or the First
International Data Analysis Challenge for Finding Supernovae, is a competition
which was held in conjuction with the IEEE Cluster/Grid 2008 international
conference in Tsukuba, Japan. The competition was organized and supported by
the <a href="http://www.ieeetcsc.org/">IEEE Technical Committee on Scalable
    Computing</a>, the Japan MEXT grant-in-aid for priority area research
called <a
    href="http://www.infoplosion.nii.ac.jp/info-plosion/ctr.php/m/IndexEng/a/Index/">Info-Plosion</a>,
and the Special Interest Group on High Performance Computing (SIGHPC) of the <a
    href="http://www.ipsj.or.jp/english/index.html">Information Processing
    Society of Japan (IPSJ)</a>.</p><p>The competition was driven by the
observation that the importance of large scale data analysis increases every
year, not only in the scientific domain (e.g. high energy physics, astronomy,
biology), but also in industry (e.g. web search engines). The objective of the
competition was to follow this emerging trend, and to encourage efficient data
analysis efforts in distributed environments.</p><p>In the DACH challenge a
large distributed database (of several hundreds of GBytes) of scientific data,
gathered by the Subaru telescope in Hawaii, had to be searched to find new and
unknown <em>supernova candidates</em>. A supernova is a phenomenon in which a
star explodes in a spectacular manner, causing a very large amount of light to
be emitted. For the calculations, the participants were given access to a
supercomputer system comprising of 12 compute clusters distributed over
Japan.</p><p>In the Basic Category, the goal was to process all the data as
fast as possible. Our Ibis-based solution obtained by far the fastest result.
While we required only 36 minutes for all calculations, the second best team
used more than 1 hour. All other teams obtained run-times of 3 to even more
than 25 times
longer.</p>

implemented in Maestro, a self-organizing data-flow programming model based on
the Ibis IPL. Maestro was the only system that participated in the Fault
Tolerant challenge. It used a total of 92 nodes, 34 of which were killed, and
one of which crashed by itself. Maestro automatically restarted about 10
percent of all tasks, before returning the correct
result.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><hr size="2"

real-world problem solving using scalable computing techniques. The contest
focused on end-to-end problem solving using concepts, technologies and
architectures (including clusters and grids) relevant to the overall scope of
the TCSC. All participants in the challenge were expected to identify
significant current real-world problems where scalable computing techniques can
be effectively used, and to design, implement, evaluate and demonstrate their
solutions.</p><p>At SCALE 2008 we presented a scalable distributed
supercomputing solution for the multimedia domain. Specifically, we developed
an application in which a digital camera is capable of real-time 'recognition'
of objects from a set of learned objects, while being connected to a world-wide
grid system comprising of clusters in Europe, the United States, and
Australia.</p><p>With our application we demonstrated true <em>wall-socket grid
    computing</em>. The entire application, including all required libraries,
were stored on a single memory stick, which could be plugged into any Linux or
Windows laptop with an appropriate JVM installed. From there, the application
was compiled and started, with the world-wide set of available grid resources
being employed entirely
transparently.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><hr

the 22nd Conference on Artificial Intelligence, was the 2007 edition of the
leading conference series in the field of AI. It was held in Vancouver, British
Columbia, Canada from July 22–26, 2007. The purpose of the conference was to
promote research in AI and scientific exchange among AI researchers,
practitioners, scientists, and engineers in related disciplines.</p><p>AAAI
2007 held an exciting new event, which took place during the opening reception:
<a href="http://www.aivideo.org/2007">the AI Video Competition</a>. The
objective of the competition was to communicate to the world the fun of
pursuing research in AI, and illustrate the impact of some of its application
areas. Submitters were asked to create narrated videos of 1-5 minutes in
length, focused on interesting AI research. Videos were then reviewed by an
international program committee. The creators of the best videos were presented
with awards named in honor of Shakey, SRI's pioneering robot.</p><p><a
    href="http://www.multimedian.nl/en/">MultimediaN</a> is a Dutch
public-private non-profit organization in which the scientific world cooperates
with industrial and other non-profit institutions. Together they strive to
achieve high-quality multimedia solutions for the digital world of today and
tomorrow. MultimediaN researchers Frank Seinstra and Jan-Mark Geusebroek (ISLA,
Informatics Institute, University of Amsterdam) submitted a video on their
research project "<a
    href="http://www.science.uva.nl/~fjseins/aibo.html">Color-Based Object
    Recognition by a Grid-Connected Robot Dog</a>" to the AI Video Competition,
and won the award in the most prestigeous category: "Most Visionary Research".
The video demonstrates their unique application in which a visual task is
successfully performed by a robot which is connected to a set of compute
clusters located around the world.</p><p>The application presented in the video
is a close integration between a parallel image and video processing library
implemented in C++ and MPI, and a wide-area communication and deployment
framework, implemented in Java and Ibis (in fact: IPL and JavaGAT). The system
itself has been shown live at several international conferences, such as ICME
2005 (Amsterdam, The Netherlands), ECCV 2006 (Graz, Austria), SC2007 (Reno, NV,
USA). Clearly, without the benefits of the Ibis system, moving the application
from a controlled laboratory setting to a real-world and hostile grid
environment would have been close to
impossible.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><hr size="2"
