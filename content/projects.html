<h2>Grid Computing</h2>
<p>
Grid computing promises the integration of high-performance computing
facilities, large-scale data repositories, and high-end visualization
devices,  geographically distributed around the globe, into large
<em>virtual organizations.</em> The name <em>computational grid</em>
has been chosen in analogy to the electrical power grid where you
can tap electrical power by simply "plugging in," without even
thinking about where the energy is actually produced.  Likewise,
grid computing promises access to computing cycles and data
repositories independent of the actual service providers.
</p>

<p>
In our group we are have developed, and are still refining,
a number of complementary support
libraries (`middleware') to make grid computing accessible.

</p>
<p>
As our work is mostly practically oriented, your programming skills should 
at least be reasonable.
</p>

<h3>Open Topics</h3>

<p>
The following open topics are grouped by projects or topic area.
The following descriptions merely indicate topics; the exact definition of
an M.Sc. project needs to be negotiated with the individual student,
to match interests and also the size of 36 ECTS credit points per project.
For other types of projects 
(like an Individual Programming Assignment for PDCS students),
size and orientation of a project can be varied.
If you are interested in doing your thesis with us,
please contact <a href="http://www.cs.vu.nl/~reeuwijk/">dr.ir. Kees van Reeuwijk</a>.

<h3>Ibis: Efficient Java Based Grid Computing</h3>

<p>
<a href="http://www.cs.vu.nl/ibis">The Ibis project</a>
 is creating an efficient, Java-based platform for grid 
computing. The Ibis project currently consists of the Ibis communication 
library, a variety of programming models, 
the Java Grid Application Toolkit (JavaGAT), 
and the Zorilla peer-to-peer grid middleware. 
All components can be deployed on any grid platform, due to the use of Java.
</p>

<ul>
<li><b>JavaGAT scripting interface / shell</b></li>

<p>
Running experiments on any grid system is hard. Jobs tend to get stuck
in a queue, fail for unknown reasons, and keeping track of all input
files, output files and code is quite hard. Using the JavaGAT,
applications can use grid systems in an easy, consistent manner.
However, there is no way to use the JavaGAT directly from a command
line. If a set of command-line tools would be available for the GAT this
would be possible. This could be in te form of a JavaGAT shell, a number
of stand-alone tools, a specialized scripting language with an
interpreter, or all of the above.
</p>

<li><b>GAT Desktop</b></li>

<p>
Design and Implementation of a GAT Desktop. Using the JavaGAT as a
backend, this environment is able to submit jobs, handle files, steer
and monitor applications running on a grid, all from a drag-and-drop
desktop-like environment. 
See the 
<a href="http://wiki.cogkit.org/index.php/Java_CoG_Kit">
Java CoG Desktop</a> for an example of such a system.
</p>

<li><b>Adaptive Applications using JavaGAT</b></li>

<p>
At present there is a "Adaptive" module in Ibis which is able to
automatically adapt the resources of a running application to (changes
in) the environment. New resources are automatically added if an
application is too slow, surplus resources are freed if they are not
needed anymore, and failing or slow resources are removed from the
computation. There are, however, a few issues with the current
implementations. First, it is only able to use Zorilla as a resource
broker and second it is only able to monitor and steer Satin
applications. Adaptive JavaGAT would be a re-design and
re-implementation of this module which is ideally able to adapt any
application running on any middleware supported by the JavaGAT.
</p>

<li><b>A Proxy GAT</b></li>

<p>
While the (Java)GAT nicely interfaces to various grid middleware packages,
one still needs to have adaptors to all this middleware installed on the
client machine from which GAT applications should be run. Installation
of grid middleware on client machines can be fairly heavy-weight 
(e.g., Globus). Alternatively, one could implement a set of proxy adaptors
that communicate using ssh from a light-weight client machine (like a laptop)
to a machine on which both a "real" GAT and the middleware is installed.
This way, GAT programs could run without any middleware installation on
the client machines.
</p>


<li><b>JavaGAT Grenchmark</b></li>

<p>
<a href="http://grenchmark.st.ewi.tudelft.nl/">GrenchMark</a>
is a framework for synthetic Grid workloads generation,
submission to real / simulated environments, and for retrieving and
analyzing the submission results. Currently, Grenchmark is able to run
applications using Koala and a few other middlewares. Extend Grenchmark
to use the JavaGAT as a back-end
such that is possible to run Grenchmark on other middlewares (for instance
Zorilla) as well.
</p>
</ul>

<h2>Bachelors Theses</h2>


Within the field of grid computing, topics for bachelors theses can also be 
made available.
According to our 
<a href="http://www.cs.vu.nl/cs/projects.html"><strong>general ideas
about Bachelors theses</strong></a> we can offer literature-study type of
assignments that explore certain aspects of grids.
For these topics, we are currently interested in the answers to the open 
questions. This means that your thesis would not just be written for getting 
the grade and immediate disposal in the trash...

<h2>Programming assignments</h2>

Some smaller or non-scientific projects, suitable, for example, for
an Individual Programming Assignment for PDCS students.


<ul>
<li><b>JSDL support for the JavaGAT</b></li>

Website quote:
"The Job Submission Description Language (JSDL) is a language for
describing the requirements of computational jobs for submission to
resources, particularly in Grid environments, though not restricted to
the latter."

Multiple projects have started to implement 
<a href="http://www.gridforum.org/documents/GFD.56.pdf">JSDL</a> 
interfaces to their middleware. With a JSDL-aware frontend for the JavaGAT,
it would be possible to use JSDL on a number of different middlewares.

<li><b>JavaGAT SRB adaptor</b></li>

The JavaGAT is currently somewhat low on storage adaptors. An adaptor
for the 
<a href="http://www.sdsc.edu/srb/index.php/Main_Page">
Storage Resource Broker(SRB)</a> 
system would help to fill this gap.

Quote from the SRB website:
"The Storage Resource Broker (SRB) is a Data Grid Management System
(DGMS) or simply a logical distributed file system based on a
client-server architecture which presents the user with a single global
logical namespace or file hierarchy."

<li><b>JavaGAT Condor adaptor</b></li>

<a href="http://www.cs.wisc.edu/condor/">Condor</a> 
is one of the most stable middleware systems currently available.
Unfortunately the JavaGAT is not able to use it, as there is no adaptor
for Condor. Design and implement a job submission adaptor 
for Condor in the JavaGAT. Also, an evaluation of this adaptor on a pool of
student lab machines will completement this project.

</ul>
