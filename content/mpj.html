<h2>Mpj: MPI for Java</h2>

<p>The MPJ programming interface has been defined by the Java Grande forum to provide MPI-like message passing for Java applications.  MPJ/Ibis is a pure-Java implementation of this interface, and delivers high-performance communication, while being deployable on various platforms, from Myrinet-based clusters to grids. See <a href="publications.html#MPJ">a paper by Markus Bornemann et. al.</a> for more details.</p>
