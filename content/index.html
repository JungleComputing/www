<h2>Welcome to the Ibis webpage.</h2>

<p>This is the website of Ibis. Ibis is an <em>open source</em> Java distributed computing software project of the <a href="http://www.cs.vu.nl/cs">Computer Systems group</a>, which is part of the <a href="http://www.cs.vu.nl">Computer Science department</a> of the <a href="http://www.few.vu.nl">Faculty of Sciences</a> at the <a href="http://www.vu.nl">VU University</a>, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.</p>

<p>The main goal of the Ibis project is to create an efficient Java-based platform for distributed computing. The Ibis project currently consists of the IPL (a communication library), a variety of programming models, the Java Grid Application Toolkit, and the Zorilla peer-to-peer middleware. All components can be deployed on any compute platform, due to the use of Java.

<p>See the various sections of this website for documentation on the Ibis subprojects, downloads, users of Ibis and other information.</p>

<p>For the all-important question "How do I pronounce Ibis?", please <a href="downloads/rob.mp3">listen to</a> the recording of one of the
project members explaining this in detail.</p>

<!--
<p>Using Ibis, software can be developed which runs reliably and efficiently on a grid. Programs can, through Ibis, make use of high speed networking hardware while still remaining portable. It is possible to write Ibis programs using multiple programming models, including standard Java RMI, models which support group communication, a divide-and-conquer model, and message passing.</p>

<p>To learn more about Ibis, see the <a href="documentation.html">documentation</a> section. Ibis is also available for download <a href="downloads.html">here</a>, including source code and example programs. See the <a href="users.html">users</a> section for other people using Ibis. Previous software projects by the <a href="people.html">developers</a> of Ibis, and related work by other researchers is listed in the <a href="related.html">related work</a> section. See the <a href="contact.html">contact</a> page if you need more information, would like to give feedback or report a bug in Ibis.</p>
