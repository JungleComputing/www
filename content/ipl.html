<h2>The Ibis Portability Layer (IPL)</h2>

<p>The Ibis Portability layer (IPL) is a communication library specifically
designed for usage in a grid environment. It has a number of properties which
help to achieve its goal of providing programmers with an easy to use, reliable
grid communication infrastructure</p>

<dl> <dt><strong>Run anywhere</strong></dt> <dd>Ibis, is programmed in
Java. Because of this it is possible to use Ibis programs anywhere a
Java Virtual machine is available.</dd>

<dt><strong>Efficient</strong></dt> <dd>In addition to the standard
network types available in Java, Ibis is able to use fast local networks
such as Myrinet where these are available. If multiple network types are
present on a single system, Ibis will automatically select the best type
available.

<dt><strong>Flexible</strong></dt> <dd>By offering multiple
communication models, not ony unicast communication, it is possible to
express virtually any communication pattern easily and efficiently using
Ibis.</dd>

<dt><strong>Malleable</strong></dt> <dd>Availability of resources in
grid system changes constantly as network and hardware fail and new
resources get added to a grid. Ibis offers support for keeping track of
machines in a computation to address these problems.  </dd>

<dt><strong>Simple</strong></dt> <dd>The design of the IPL is
deliberately kept simple. This makes adding support for new network
types easy, and allowes for easy adaptation of Ibis as an communication
framework.</dd> </dl>

<h3>System Overview</h3>

<img class=floating src="images/ibis-design.png" alt="ibis design">

<p>Ibis was designed to be used in a multi layer system.  On top of the system
are the applications. These applications can use any of the programming models
present in the Ibis project.  The Ibis Portability Layer (IPL) acts as a common
interface for the different programming models to the bottom implementation
layer.  Multiple implementations are available. Some, such as TcpIbis using
100% Java code to ensure portability, and some, such as the MPI based Ibis
implementation taking advantage of local high speed networks using native
code.</p>

<h3>Implementations</h3>

The IPL communication library includes a number of implementations.

<h4>TCP</h4>

<p>The TCP based implementation Tcp is written in 100% pure Java, using
the sockets available in the standard Java library. As such it is
possible to use this Ibis implementation on any system which has a Java
Virtual Machine Available.</p>

<h4>Smartsockets</h4>

<p>Like the TCP version, the Ibis based on Smartsockets is written in
100% pure Java.  However, since it uses the Smartsockets library of the
Ibis project it also has very good support for dealing with network
difficulties such as firewalls and NATs.</p>

<h4>MPIbis</h4>

<p>One of the most used ways of using a high speed network in clusters
today is MPI. For this reason practically every high speed network in
use today has the possibility to communicate using a implementation of
MPI. For this reason we are currently in the process of builing an Ibis
implementation which uses MPI as the underlying communication layer.
Early results are very promising, but more work is needed to complete
this implementation fully.</p>

<h4>P2PIbis</h4>

<p>An implementation we are currently looking at is an Ibis which sends
message over a peer-to-peer network. This would have the advantage that
it would be very resilant agains network problems such as failing
connections, and firewalls.</p>

<h4>UDPIbis</h4>

<p>An interesting addition to the available Ibisses would be an Ibis
implemented on top of UDP. This is currently in progress.</p>
