<h2>Programming Models</h2>

<p>The
Ibis project contains several programming models for developing parallel applications:
</p>

<dl>
    <dt>Satin</dt>
    <dd>A divide-and-conquer model, especially designed for both clusters and grids.</dd>

    <dt>MPJ/Ibis</dt>
    <dd>A 100% Java implementation of the Java bindings for MPI.</dd>

    <dt>GMI</dt>
    <dd>Group Method Invocation. An extension of the standard RMI model of Java with distributed features.</dd>

    <dt>Ibis RMI</dt>
    <dd>An alternative, highly optimized implementation of the standard Java Remote Method Invocation functionality. Can be used as a drop-in replacement of standard RMI, for a significant increase in performance.</dd>
